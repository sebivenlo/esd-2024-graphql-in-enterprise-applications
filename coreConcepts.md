Quesries a api not a database
No need to specify what kind of http request is sent
get = query
put,delete,post - mutation
1 way - Frontend - graphql - backend(rest) - database
2 way - frontend - graphql - database
single endpoint
must be the specified type and not null(!)
Every graphQL needs a type Quesry whuich holds every query that you can make withall data that you can request. They not necesarely need a type. they can be a filter or code called input. 
when you have a type which is not basic graphql type, you need to specify the fields that you want.
